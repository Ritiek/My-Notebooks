# What is this place?

Just some Jupyter Notebooks that I might want to address later on.

## Contents:

- [matplotlib_basics.ipynb](matplotlib/matplotlib_basics.ipynb) - Holds basics of plotting, axis, labels, histographs in matplotlib (adopted mostly from [offical docs](http://matplotlib.org/users/pyplot_tutorial.html))
